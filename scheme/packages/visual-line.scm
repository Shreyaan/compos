;;; visual-line.scm --- visual-line-mode: motion over rendered rows.
;;;
;;; The client reports where the rendered rows begin (the wrap map); this
;;; minor mode decides what a key means on those rows. Loaded from init.scm.

;;; --- visual lines --------------------------------------------------------------
;;; Visual lines are a buffer capability, independent of the major mode.
;;; This minor mode owns the durable flag. The client measures where the
;;; rendered rows begin and reports the byte offsets per window, tagged
;;; with the buffer version it measured: the wrap map. The client cannot
;;; know what a key means on those rows; that is decided here.
