;;; group-cycle-test.scm --- one key walks a group's buffers, most recently
;;; used first, and flips between the last two the way Alt-Tab flips between
;;; two windows. A window walks its preferred mode automatically.
;;; The walk never leaves the group and never leaves the window.
;;;
;;; No test presses a key. The commands drive the walk, and no test names a
;;; binding: a binding is a preference.
