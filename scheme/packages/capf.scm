;;; --- completion framework (capf) ---------------------------------------------
;;; A completion source is a closure of no arguments returning either
;;;   #f                                — source has nothing here
;;;   (list start end candidates)      — region to replace + candidates,
;;;                                       each a string or (label hint) pair
;;;   (list start end candidates 'exclusive 'no)
;;;                                    — the same, and when CANDIDATES is
;;;                                       empty the next source is tried
;;; Sources are tried in order; the first that answers wins (Emacs capf).
;;; END may lie past point: accept replaces START..END, so a source that
;;; completes over a suffix names the whole word. An LSP client is just
;;; another source returning the same shape.
;;; Buffer-local sources: (buffer-set-local! buf 'capf-sources (list fn ...))
