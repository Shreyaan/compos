;;; recipes.scm --- task -> expression.
;;;
;;; apropos answers "what is this called". A recipe answers the question
;;; before that: "how do I do the thing". An agent that knows the editor
;;; has an API still has to compose three calls in the right order to open
;;; a file in a split, and getting that wrong costs a round-trip each time.
;;;
;;; These are the tasks agents actually perform. Keep them short enough to
;;; paste and true enough to run. Add yours with (defrecipe! ...).
