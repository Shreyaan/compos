;;; test.scm --- Scheme tests for Scheme policy.
;;;
;;; Most of what this editor decides is Scheme: membership, resolution,
;;; naming, matching, ranking. A test of that policy does not need a
;;; keystroke, a window, or a frame. It needs the function and a value.
;;;
;;; A test is a thunk under a name:
;;;
;;;   (deftest 'group-rename-keeps-the-id
;;;     "a rename moves the name and leaves the id alone"
;;;     (lambda ()
;;;       (let ((id (group-record-create! "t-a")))
;;;         (group-rename! id "t-b")
;;;         (check-equal! (group-name id) "t-b" "the name follows")
;;;         (check-equal! (group-resolve-id "t-b") id "the id is stable")
;;;         (group-record-delete! id))))
;;;
;;; A check records its failure and returns; it does not raise. One bad
;;; assertion reports every other assertion in the same test.
;;;
;;; (run-test 'name) answers () when the test passes, or a list of the
;;; failures it found. The ExUnit bridge runs one eval per test, so a
;;; test that raises fails alone and the rest still run.
;;;
;;; Keep a test hermetic: make what it needs, and delete it at the end.
;;; Tests share one live editor.
