;;; handheld.scm --- policy for the handheld client.
;;;
;;; The handheld client (/m) is a second client of the same frame payload
;;; the desktop renders. Elixir draws it and forwards every gesture as a
;;; key. This file decides what the client offers: the prefixes on the
;;; chord fan, which keys the fan shows under a prefix, the tab rail, the
;;; chips above the composer, and what the composer does with a line of
;;; text.
;;;
;;; The composer has three registers. A literal chord dispatches its keys.
;;; "M-x NAME" runs the named command. Anything else goes to the group's
;;; chat as a message.
