;;; --- text scale (Emacs text-scale-mode, on the Cmd chords) ---------------
;;; Two scales. Each is a ladder of factors 1.2^N (text-scale-mode-step).
;;;
;;; The application scale: Cmd-= / Cmd-- / Cmd-0. It sets the zoom of the
;;; 'ui face. The page applies that root variable as `zoom` on the editor
;;; root, so every window, the modeline, the minibuffer, and every rendered
;;; page grow together. It persists in custom.scm like a setting.
;;;
;;; The buffer scale: Cmd-Shift-= / Cmd-Shift-- / Cmd-Shift-0. Shift rides
;;; the character, so the chords arrive as s-+, s-_, and s-). The scale
;;; writes a factor into the buffer's face remap. A text window multiplies
;;; its default size by the factor. A rendered page is an iframe, a separate
;;; document that inherits no variable, so the page zooms by the factor.
;;; The remap MERGES: a buffer's own family, size, and line-height stay.
