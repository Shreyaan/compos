;;; window-motion-test.scm --- geometric focus motion, and the swap that carries a buffer.
;;;
;;; focus-move! selects the neighbor in a direction; window-swap! trades
;;; buffers with that neighbor and follows the buffer. Both read
;;; window-rects, so the tests read the same rects to name the two panes.
;;; No test here names a key: the commands are the behaviour.
