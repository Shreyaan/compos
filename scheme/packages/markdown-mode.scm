;;; markdown-mode.scm --- Markdown drawn in place: the markup steps back.
;;;
;;; This is preview-mode's painter for Markdown. It paints faces on the
;;; source and changes no byte. Markup wears md-marker and stays hidden.
;;; A heading wears its level's face, and that face carries a size. An
;;; image URL wears img-embed and draws as the picture. A line that is one
;;; X post URL wears x-embed and draws as the card. A standalone YouTube
;;; URL or #+embed directive wears youtube-embed and draws a video card.
;;;
;;; preview-mode turns the paint on and off (markdown-paint-on!,
;;; markdown-paint-off!). morg-mode owns structure and the plain faces.
