;;; --- isearch ---------------------------------------------------------------
;;; ONE search engine (dup #13), two surfaces: C-s/C-r here, evil's
;;; / ? n N in evil.scm. The engine owns the directional find, the wrap
;;; retry, and the incremental loop — capture the origin, re-search from
;;; it on every keystroke, restore it on cancel. The surface owns what a
;;; hit shows, what a miss says, and what RET keeps.
;;;
;;; One search runs at a time, so one variable holds it. The state says
;;; where the next find starts, which way it runs, and how to draw a hit.
;;; C-s and C-r in the minibuffer map move that start past the current
;;; match — the prompt stays open, the way Emacs repeats a search.
