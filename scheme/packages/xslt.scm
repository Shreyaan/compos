;;; xslt.scm --- a site parser the editor writes for itself.
;;;
;;; browse-mode reads a page through a stylesheet when the site has one, and
;;; through Readability when it does not. A hand-written stylesheet is better
;;; and costs an afternoon. This package writes one.
;;;
;;; Three steps, and each one is a stylesheet or a question:
;;;
;;;   DISCOVER  web/discover.xsl walks the page and answers a table: one row
;;;             per structural element, with its text volume, link density,
;;;             class tokens and how to address it.
;;;   JUDGE     JEV scores each row. Is this navigation, a masthead, an ad
;;;             slot, an upsell, a consent notice -- or the content?
;;;   EMIT      each flagged row becomes an empty template. The sheet copies
;;;             the document and deletes those nodes.
;;;
;;; The walk is top down, and the whole walk arrives before the first
;;; question. So the questions about a deeper level are asked speculatively
;;; beside the questions about the level above it, in one call, and code
;;; throws away every answer that sits inside a box that turned out to be
;;; furniture. Parallel questions in one call cost no more time than one
;;; question, and a page's chrome sits near its top, so a page costs one
;;; JEV call, not one per level and not one per node.
;;;
;;; Discovery and the finished parser run in the same engine, so a pattern
;;; that selects a node during discovery selects it in production.
;;;
;;; xslt-score asks JEV, so that step needs the jev package loaded. Every
;;; other step is a stylesheet or string work.
;;;
;;; The sheet is also the cache. JEV judges a site once; every later visit
;;; reads web/parsers/HOST.xsl and spends nothing.
