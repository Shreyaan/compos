# Design port: Compos v2 into the app

The design system lives in the Claude Design project `efed2c88` (readme.md,
styles.css, elements/*.css, elements/compos.js, Compos v2.html, Ibuffer
v2.html). The brief: four concepts (group, window, focus/cua, narrow), one
theme, no modals, no drag, no toolbars. This file tracks the port, stage by
stage. Each stage is one commit, verified live and by a screenshot.

## Already in the app before this port

- The token layer in `editor.css` (surfaces, text, edge, accent, scale,
  space) resolves through the faces a theme owns. Radii are 0.
- Fonts: IBM Plex Mono for chrome, Spectral for prose, Plex Sans outside.
- `paper` (light) and `paper-night` (dark) themes exist in `themes.scm`.
- The frame has a header line (wordmark, group tabs, facts) and an echo
  area. A window has a header line (dashboard line, built in Scheme) and a
  mode line.
- The minibuffer reads prompts as tables (`ibuffer-prompt!`).

## Stages

1. **Palette and frame chrome.** `paper-night` carries the design's exact
   dark tokens and boots by default. The header line is wordmark, divider,
   group tabs (tracked uppercase), rule, facts. The theme word and the
   file path leave the header line. The key hints move to the echo area
   after the message and a rule. DONE.
2. **Window bars.** Header line = identity: pin only when the group differs
   from the frame's (`modeline_pin` in editor.ex sets `data-pin`), title,
   the open change, the cua/focus tag, one switcher (`ⓘ`, M-x
   `buffer-switcher`: a narrow over buffer info, summary log, transcript
   verbosity). Mode line = state: dot, name, context, mode/llm/lane facts
   (`dash--modeline-facts`, the `modeline-facts` local, ranked so the lane
   sheds first), position. A window at rest keeps both bars whole and
   steps its ink down. DONE.
3. **Three window states.** At rest: kept down (`.window.inactive` remaps
   the text and surface tokens). Current cua: sits (paper, hairline, the
   theme's `chrome shadow`). Current focus: floats (lifted ground, nearer
   hairline, `chrome shadow-deep`). The inset group-colour ring is gone.
   A window is now a container, so its bars shed facts by its own width.
   DONE.
4. **Keys bar.** Every list-mode buffer carries its keymap as a bar at
   the window's foot, full width, in flow above the mode line and never
   over the rows (a ruling over the design's floating card). The mode
   declares the main keys as its `footer`; the bar adds `? all N` and
   owns `?`. `?` (`list-keys-toggle`) grows it into a grid per keymap
   from `keys--expand`. No list buffer says anything about keys in its
   head lines any more. Every pressable key is one element,
   `c-action-key`, so it is always one colour. DONE.
5. **Narrow at full size.** `C-x C-b` opens `*ibuffer*` as a list buffer
   in a window, `/` narrows it in the minibuffer, and the row at point
   previews in the other window (the no-popup-previews ruling). That is
   the design's mechanism already. Left to do: the facts (group:, sort:)
   move from the ibuffer head line onto the keys card, and the `panel`
   and `modal` minibuffer geometries lose their centring and scrim so a
   grown minibuffer stays docked at the bottom.
6. **Focus/cua move.** `window-left/right/up/down` already trade a window
   with its neighbour by direction and say `No window left` through the
   echo area; the editing (cua) state gives the same chords to the caret.
   The mechanism exists; nothing to add.

## Open questions

- Mode glyphs come from a Nerd Font (`mode-icon!` in editor.scm). The brief says Unicode
  glyphs only, derived from the mode: `λ` code, `◍` chat, `✉` mail. A
  later stage swaps the registry.
- Two `editor_live_test.exs` tests assert the old `phx-value-cmd="mode:..."`
  click on the expanded panel; the panel moved to `block_click` with
  `dash-mode:` before this port. They fail at HEAD too.

- The echo area's key hints come from Scheme: the `echo-key-hints`
  custom in appearance.scm, published with `frame-chrome-set!`. The
  window mode line is the `mode-line-format` custom beside it.
- `load-theme` stays as an M-x command. The brief says one theme; the other
  themes remain loadable by name.
