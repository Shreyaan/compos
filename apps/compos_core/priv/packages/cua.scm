;;; cua.scm --- CUA selection: Shift extends the region.
;;;
;;; The shared mechanism behind Emacs's cua-mode and shift-select-mode: a
;;; motion with Shift held starts a region at point when there is none and
;;; extends it. The commands here move by the same primitives as the plain
;;; motions, so a mode that changes what a line or a word is changes them
;;; too. cua-mode owns the keys, in every buffer you are editing.
