;;; keymaps.scm --- the keymap editor: every key in force, and the edits.
;;;
;;; M-x keys opens the list. It holds every binding the buffer you came
;;; from answers to, in ladder order, with the map each one comes from
;;; and a mark on the ones a nearer map shadows. RET describes the row,
;;; b gives the command on the row another key, d takes its key away,
;;; + binds a command that has no key, u takes back an edit of yours,
;;; and s widens the list to every keymap in the editor.
;;;
;;; An edit is one row of user-key-bindings: (MAP KEYS COMMAND WAS).
;;; COMMAND #f means the key is unbound, and WAS is what the key ran
;;; before, so u can put it back. customize writes that variable to
;;; custom.scm, which loads last at boot: the edits land after every
;;; package has made its maps, and the keys you chose come back.
;;;
;;; The editor never guesses a map. A rebind writes the map the row came
;;; from; an unbind writes the map that owns the binding, which for a
;;; key behind a prefix is the map the prefix leads to.
