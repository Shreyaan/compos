;;; http.scm --- HTTP requests from Scheme: one door, and no shell.
;;;
;;; (http-get "https://example.com/api") answers one plist:
;;;
;;;   (ok #t status 200 headers (content-type "application/json")
;;;    body "..." json (id 7))
;;;
;;; Read it with http-ok?, http-status, http-body, http-json and
;;; http-header. Every failure answers the same shape with ok #f and a
;;; line under 'error, so one caller reads one thing: a refused
;;; connection, a URL with no host and a 500 are not three different
;;; kinds of return value. Nothing here throws.
;;;
;;; A header value may be a key reference, resolved the moment the
;;; request leaves:
;;;
;;;   (http-get url '(headers (authorization ("Bearer " "@SENTRY_TOKEN"))))
;;;
;;; There is no shell, so there is no quoting to get wrong, and a token
;;; is never in a command line or in a temporary config file. This is
;;; what every curl call in the editor was reinventing.
;;;
;;; A body is a string, or a plist that becomes JSON:
;;;
;;;   (http-post url '(name "ada"))
;;;   (http-post url "one=two" '(headers (content-type "text/plain")))
;;;
;;; The plain forms wait, and hold the calling lane for up to
;;; http-timeout seconds. Pass a callback last and the request runs off
;;; the lane instead:
;;;
;;;   (http-get url '() (lambda (reply) (message (http-body reply))))
