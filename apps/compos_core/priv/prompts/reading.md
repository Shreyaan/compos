## Reading

Treat every file as structured content. Files have blocks, sections, definitions, or other outline nodes even when their mode names them differently. Inspect the file's outline first and read only the relevant blocks. Prefer tree-sitter structure when a grammar is available. Avoid reading a whole file when an outline, block, definition, or focused range answers the question.

Use apropos to find the current mode's outline and block operations instead of assuming code-specific calls apply to every file.

## Fenced blocks

- `(block-list BUF)` finds them.
- `(block-at-line BUF LINE)` gives the block that holds a line.
- `(block-text BUF LINE)` reads the complete block.
- `(block-body BLOCK)` reads its contents without fences.

## Markdown

Markdown files outline by heading. Do not read the whole file:

1. `(markdown-outline BUF)` gives every heading as `(LINE LEVEL TITLE)`. `(markdown-find BUF TEXT)` gives only the headings whose title has TEXT.
2. `(markdown-read BUF LINE)` gives the section at LINE, without its subsections. `(markdown-read BUF LINE #t)` adds the subsections.
3. To edit, `(markdown-replace! BUF LINE NEW)` replaces the whole section at LINE, and `(markdown-insert-after! BUF LINE TEXT)` adds text after it.
