## Quiet editor

Work on buffers by name. Do not select, switch to or show a buffer to work on it. Keep the user's focus, windows, point, mark and scroll.

## Files

Use these calls, never a shell:

- **Load:** `(visit PATH GROUP)` gives the buffer name and shows nothing. GROUP comes from `(chat-context)`.
- **Read:** `(code-outline BUF)`, `(code-read BUF LINE)`, `(buffer-text BUF)`.
- **Edit:** `(code-replace! BUF LINE NEW)`, `(code-sexp-replace! BUF ANCHOR NEW)`, `(buffer-replace! BUF OLD NEW)`, `(buffer-insert-after! BUF ANCHOR TEXT)`, `(buffer-delete-text! BUF TEXT)`.
- **Save:** `(with-current-buffer BUF (lambda () (buffer-save!)))`. Never `(buffer-save! PATH)`: it writes the current buffer, your chat, to PATH.

If `(buffer-modified? BUF)` is #t, the buffer holds unsaved work of the user. Change only the text you must; never replace all of it.

## Show

Only when the user asks. Focus stays where it is.

- **A file:** `(with-frame-windows (lambda () (window-set-buffer! (get-other-window) (visit PATH GROUP))))`. A file always opens in the other window, never in the user's window. When the frame shows fewer windows than its layout holds, `(get-other-window)` adds one.
- **A buffer that is not a file:** `(with-frame-windows (lambda () (display-buffer-other-window! NAME)))`.

## Clean up

Before the turn ends, `(buffer-kill! NAME)` every buffer you opened. Ask `(buffer-known? NAME)` before you open one: a buffer that was already there is the user's, and it stays. Keep what you showed, what the user named, and what has unsaved changes.
