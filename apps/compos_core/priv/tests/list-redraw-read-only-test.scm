;;; list-redraw-read-only-test.scm --- a list redraw leaves the read-only flag alone.
;;;
;;; The redraw writes with buffer-replace-range!, a programmatic write
;;; that bypasses read-only on its own. A redraw that flipped the flag
;;; off and on reached the browser as two patches when a hook redrew
;;; the list outside a command. Between the two patches the buffer was
;;; editable, the client took the caret, and the second patch left that
;;; caret at the end of the buffer: point moved to the last row.
