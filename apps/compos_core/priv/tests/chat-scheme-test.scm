;;; chat-scheme-test.scm --- the chat prompt is a REPL as well as a prompt.
;;;
;;; An input that reads as a parenthesised expression runs in the editor and
;;; prints into the transcript: no turn is spent, and the model is never told
;;; it happened. Prose that has to open with a paren escapes it.
