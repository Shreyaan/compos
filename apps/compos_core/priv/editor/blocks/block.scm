;;; block.scm --- what every waiting block shares.
;;; ./docs/editor/blocks/diff-block.md
;;; A block is a fenced span of text that an action lands in a document
;;; and a person decides. This file holds the mechanics every such block
;;; uses: reading and replacing its text, landing it below a passage,
;;; stripping its fences by structure, finding it again through edits,
;;; binding its verb keys, and the line diff its renderings draw from.
;;; A concrete block (diff-block.scm) owns its record, its states, its
;;; paint, and its verbs.

;; the block vocabulary is the editor's
