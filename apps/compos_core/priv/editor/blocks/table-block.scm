;;; table-block.scm --- a table fence: a table whose cells take font colors.
;;;
;;; A table block holds a Markdown pipe table or space-aligned columns. The
;;; page draws each body line as a table row. The fence arguments are color
;;; rules, tried in order; the first rule that matches a cell colors it:
;;;
;;;   ```table green=strong yellow=potential red=unfit
;;;   ```table green>=.7 yellow>=.4 red<.4
;;;
;;; COLOR=A,B matches a cell whose text is A or B. COLOR<N, COLOR<=N,
;;; COLOR>N and COLOR>=N match a cell that is a number. A cell that no rule
;;; matches tries each of its words, so "potential .60" colors both words.
;;; The colors are theme faces: table-red, table-green, table-yellow,
;;; table-blue, table-purple, table-cyan, and table-gray. Both the source
;;; view and the page draw them.

;; the block vocabulary is the editor's
