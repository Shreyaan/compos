defmodule Compos.SubagentResultTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The turn-end hook, and what a parent reads off a child.

  A real Agent ends a real turn behind Backend.Stub, with no wire. What is
  under test is everything that hangs off that turn end:

    * agent.ex dispatches it to Scheme once the turn has RENDERED, on the
      :ui lane, and agent.scm fans it out as on-agent-turn-end!.
    * a child reports STRUCTURALLY: (subagent-result SLUG) reads the child's
      own last message and costs the parent no turn at all.
    * 'notify #t is the opt-in exception, a free-text wake into the parent.
    * subagent-wait answers a parent that fanned out to several children.
