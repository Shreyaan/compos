defmodule Compos.DesktopSessionRestartTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Every persisted global lives in a Scheme variable, so the Session owns
  them all. When the Session dies, its replacement boots a new interpreter
  holding only the defvar defaults, while the frames and buffers on the
  Elixir side carry on unchanged. The desktop must put the values back, and
  it must never write the defaults over the file in the meantime.

  On 2026-09-11 it wrote them: one autosave replaced 35 group records, the
  group graveyard, both connector catalogs and every history with the
  empty set.
