defmodule Compos.Core.BufferHistoryStore do
  @moduledoc """
  Durable Loro documents, one log file per buffer. See `docs/PROVENANCE-CRDT.md`.

  A buffer checkpoint holds the text. This holds the history behind it: who
  wrote each part, in what order, and what every earlier state was.

  The file is a sequence of length-prefixed blobs. The first is a snapshot and
  the rest are updates, which is what makes the common write cheap: 500 typed
  characters export as about 1.2 KB, while a snapshot of the same 85 KB source
  file is 75 KB. Appending on every checkpoint would be unaffordable at
  snapshot size and is nothing at update size.

  Reading imports every blob in order. Loro accepts a snapshot and an update
  through the same call, so the reader does not care which is which, and
  importing the same bytes twice changes nothing.

  A torn tail is expected rather than exceptional: a crash between the write
  and the flush leaves a partial frame. The reader stops at the first frame it
  cannot trust and keeps everything before it, so a crash costs the last batch
  and never the history.
